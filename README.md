## Here are some reviews of our client's users:

KozlovBypasser: Thank you so much for the client, I was able to destroy another hacker that was using a client for 35$. However, KozlovClient is free, so i don't need to buy any clients for a block game! 69/10!

## How to build (Do this at your own risk):

1. Sit down please, this will be long
2. Make sure you have a fancy gaming chair, otherwise the client won't build
3. Go to https://github.com/podliver/KozlovClient/blob/main/build-linux.txt and run it in your terminal. (if you're using a shitty OS, go to https://github.com/podliver/KozlovClient/blob/main/build-windows.txt)
4. Pray to the Kozlov God
5. Pray again
6. Restart your PC
7. The client will start automatically
